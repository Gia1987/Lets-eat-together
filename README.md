# LET'S EAT TOGETHER

The app works this way: you tell it your whereabouts, your schedule (the time you usually eat), and who like to eat with (age, gender, etc.). Then each day the app matches you with someone who meets your criteria, finds a restaurant/cafe nearby and a time convenient to your schedule, and sends you (and your match) an invitation to eat together which you can either accept or reject.
